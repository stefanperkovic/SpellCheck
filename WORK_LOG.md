We discusses trying to represent strings into some sort of integer form that we could use to decrease the search time when checking if a word is in a dictionary. We also discusses hash maps which as I understand are similar to a python dictionary, so that we can just quickly check if a word exists by telling if it has a value associated with it. |

I then looped through the dictionary and added each word from it into the hashmap with the associated boolean value of true. I don't think theirs much importance of what is stored in each value, but maybe later on it will be useful to have an output that tells you it exists. This loop means we have a minimum runtime of O(n) where n represents the dictionary length, but it should save us search time later on. |
| Sep 25 | 5:45-6:20 | I have created a Hashmap and ArrayList for all the other words that arent found in the dictionary. That way we can store them in order in the ArrayList and also be able to easily lookup if their are duplicates within words that are not found in the dictionary so that we don't put them in the list twice. I then created a loop that goes through each word in the dictionary and cheks if it is found in the hash map using the very convient containsKey() function. If its not found then I check if its already been added to the misspelled words hashmap. If not then, I add it to the arraylist and also add it to the misspelled words hashmap to prevent duplicates. |
