We discusses trying to represent strings into some sort of integer form that we could use to decrease the search time when checking if a word is in a dictionary. We also discusses hash maps which as I understand are similar to a python dictionary, so that we can just quickly check if a word exists by telling if it has a value associated with it. |
| Sep 25 | 5-5:30  | I have gone ahead and created a Hashmap to store each of the words found in our dictionary. I then looped through the dictionary and added each word from it into the hashmap with the associated boolean value of true. I don't think theirs much importance of what is stored in each value, but maybe later on it will be useful to have an output that tells you it exists. This loop means we have a minimum runtime of O(n) where n represents the dictionary length, but it should save us search time later on. |
